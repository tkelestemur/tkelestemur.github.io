## About Me

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Covariant AI](https://covariant.ai/) working on AI-powered real world robotics. I received my PhD degree in Computer Engineering
from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Taskin Padir](https://robot.neu.edu/) [Prof. Robert Platt](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/) and [Prof. David Rosen](https://david-m-rosen.github.io/). During my Ph.D., I worked at the intersection of machine learning and robotic manipulation. Specifically, I was interested in combining classical and data-driven methods for visual and tactile manipulation. Previously, I was a Masters student working with [Prof. Taskin Padir](https://robot.neu.edu/) on mobile manipulation and grasping. 

I co-host a podcast on artificial intelligence and machine learning called [Veri Tezgahi](https://open.spotify.com/show/6xh1JvolfduK8j5sb1WnoC).
