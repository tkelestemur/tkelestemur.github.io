I am a Research Engineer at a stealth robotics startup. I spent 2.7 half years at the [Robotics and AI Institute](https://rai-inst.com/) as an Applied Scientist. Before that, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at [Covariant AI](https://covariant.ai/). I received my PhD degree in Computer Engineering from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Taskin Padir and Prof. Robert Platt.
